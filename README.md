### Project Features:

• I have Created a new virtual environment for this project and installed the required packages, which i have shared in requirements.txt   file. <br/>
• I have used XR Interaction Toolkit package Framework for creating VR and AR experiences. It provides a common framework for interactions and streamlines cross-platform creation. <br/>
• I have used Blender and Maya for 3D modeling of this project. <br/>
• I have used Unity 3D and Unreal as a Game Engine. <br/>
• I have used Oculus Quest 2 as a VR headset for Importing the project. <br/>
• I have used C# Language in Unity 3D. <br/>
• I have used Microsoft Bot Framework for AI-powered chatbot . <br/>

### Steps to Build the project:
1. Create a virtual environment of Project and activate it.
2. Install the required packages mentioned in `requirements.txt` file.
3. Create 3D object models into blender/Maya software.
4. Setup project in unity space for VR using XR Interaction Toolkit package.
5. Import models of blender into unity 3d game engine.
6. Production and deployment of 360° films hold educational importance.
7. Using unity for development of Application.
8. Final step is to deploy project into VR headset.

Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five 
centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
